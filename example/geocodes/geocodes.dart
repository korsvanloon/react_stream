 * Hello,
 *
 * this is a part of the tutorial to the react-dart package. We'll go through
 * a simple app that is quering Google Maps API and showing the result to the
 * user. It also stores the search history and allows to reload past queries.
 *
 * In this file you'll find the structure and the logic of the app.
 * There is also a `geocodes.html` file, that contains the mountpoint.
 *
 * Be sure that you understand the basic concepts of
 * [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) before reading this tutorial.

 * Enjoy!

 * It's a common practice to store the aplication data in the state of the
 * root component. It will redpaint every time, the state is changed. However,
 * it is not required - you can use normal variables and repaint manualy.
