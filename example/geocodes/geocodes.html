<!--
 * Hello,
 *
 * this is a part of the tutorial to the react-dart package. We'll go through
 * a simple app that is quering Google Maps API and showing the result to the
 * user. It also stores the search history and allows to reload past queries.
 *
 * In this file you'll find the mountpoint of the app. There is also
 * a `geocodes.dart` file, that contains the structure and the logic.
 *
 * Be sure that you understand the basic concepts of
 * [React](http://facebook.github.io/react/) before reading this tutorial.
 *
 * Enjoy!
